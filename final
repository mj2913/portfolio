# Hi everyone!

## I’m really excited for this project and for the progress I’ve made in this class and on my journey to learning to code. I look forward to seeing where else this journey takes me and I hope I’ll get to learn from and be challenged by you all along the way. Without further rambling, let’s jump into my final project.

## So you’ll notice that I’ve been building on my initial project based on feedback from you all and from the organization I’m working with. This project, in its most recent phase consists of 3 simple webpages.

1. The first is a sleep mode page that will be the default setting. This page is primarily built with HTML and CSS. I wanted it to be a simple and clean design with a crisp animation inspired by Claire Larsen. I introduced JavaScript to the page with an visitHomePage function that directs users to the homepage after the device awakens from sleep mode.

2. The second is the homepage I mentioned. It’s essentially a menu of options for what users can and should do on the device. It recycles the same text animation style from the sleep mode for design continuity. It goes further to introduce an array of buttons or options for the user to select from. Each button is styled using a linear gradient to invite some color and playfulness into the experience, and each button also directs the user to an external page (except for the news button that refers to innerHTML and the sign-in button that will likely include some data validation once users create their own unique profiles and sign-in information).

3. The third and final page should be much more familiar to you all. It features the emotions/mood options I introduced in earlier projects, but has had somewhat of an aesthetic makeover to brighten it up and make it more exciting and attractive for its intended youth audience.

## Debugger and Console—these guys are a new-to-coding gaps best friend. These tools allowed me to recognize when my code wasn’t having the result I intended it to have, how my code was misaligned with proper code, and what I should be thinking through in order to fix it. It didn’t just give me the answers--instead it allowed me to think through them on my own.

## Overall in this course I learned that coding is challenging yet rewarding. It gives you the freedom to create in a way that ties together my interests in design, technology, and education. Most importantly, I learned how to perform basic web design, and I’m looking forward to honing my skills!
